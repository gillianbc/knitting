## Intro
Saw a jumper knitted from this amazingly soft yarn in my local yarn shop, The Spotted Sheep. It’s a mix of recycled plastic bottles and wool. Very light weight - I’m hoping it’s as warm as fleece. I bought 2 balls in a lovely denim blue. Now that I’ve actually got around to casting on, I’ve not found that colour online in enough quantity. So, I’ve bought some in other colours and it’ll have to be a stripy cardigan.

**Yarn**
Katia Earth - doubled

**Gauge**
3.32sts / 5.08 rows per inch on 7mm needles.    13.28 sts / 20.32 rows for a 4" square.  Stitch to row ratio 0.66 so when picking up for the square neck, I need to pick up 6 from every 9 rows.  K S K K S K K S K - K S K K S K K S K

**6000 Pullover Possibilities**
Saddle shoulders, knitted flat, square neck with mitred corners. Bottom up. Finished hip 44”. 
Will follow size L for gauge 3.5.  For sleeves, I'll do size 1X for my fat arms.  I want it to be 27" long from shoulder to hem;  about 15.5" from armpit to hem.  It's 3" longer than in the book.

**Body**  
Cast on 74 sts using the COWYAK cast on method  [Tech Knitter](http://techknitting.blogspot.com/2007/10/cowyak-waste-yarn-method-of-provisional.html)  

Do some stocking stitch for a few inches. 

**Decrease For Waist**
Dec 1st each side, 10 sts from edge - every 6 rows x 4
Total dec = 8 sts.  66 sts remain.

**Continue Straight**
Approx 7" from beginning

**Increase for Bust**
Inc 1st each side, 10 sts from edge - every 6 rows x 1
Inc 1st each side, 10 sts from edge - every 8 rows x 3
Total inc = 8 sts.  74 sts remain.

Continue until piece measures 14" from beginning.  (End of first red rows)

**Armholes**
Bind off 9 at the beg of next 2 rows
You will have 74 - 18 = 56 remaining

Continue until piece measures 24 1/4"

**Shape Neck**
Place markers either side of the centre 22 sts i.e. 16 + 24 + 16 = 56
Bind off the centre 24 (Use a KFB on 1st, a K2tog on last)

Continue (if necessary) until piece measures 24.5"

**Shape Shoulders**
Bind off 5 at the beginning of the next 4 rows
Bind off 6 at the beginning of the next 4 rows

**Front**
Same as back but maybe do some short rows at the bust if that's not on a colour change.

**Square Neck**
Garter stitch
16" circular, begin at right neck.
Pick up 1 st for each bound off st.  Must be an odd number.
Pick up 1 st for each st in horizontal section.  Must be an odd number.
Pick up 6 from every 9 rows on verticals.    Must be an odd number.

**Sleeves - Top Down**
*Saddle*
Size 1X
Cast on 8st
Knit 4.5"
*Cap*
Cast on 2 sts each end of next two (RS and WS) rows - 2 rows, 8 sts increased = 8 + 8 = 16
Inc 1 each row (RS and WS) 4 times - 4 rows, 8 sts increased = 16 + 8 = 24
Inc 1 each RS row 11 times - 22 rows, 22 sts increased = 24 + 22 = 46 
Cast on 3sts each end of next row - 6 sts increased = 46 + 6 = 52
*End of Cap Shaping*
Dec 1 each side every 10 rows 3 times - 30 rows, 6 sts decreased = 52 - 6 = 46
Inc 1 each side every 8 rows 6 times - 48 rows, 12 sts decreased = 46 - 12 = 34
Work even until where cuff should start
34 sts for whatever cuff - 2.5"


**Possibilities**
Maybe broken moss for the hem and the collar. K1 P1 row, K row P1 K1 row K row.
Maybe linen stitch - 
Row 1: knit 1, *slip 1 with yarn in front, knit 1; repeat from * to end.
Row 2: purl 1, *slip 1 with yarn in back, purl 1; repeat from * to end.
