## Intro
Saw a jumper knitted from this amazingly soft yarn in my local yarn shop, The Spotted Sheep. It’s a mix of recycled plastic bottles and wool. Very light weight - I’m hoping it’s as warm as fleece. I bought 2 balls in a lovely denim blue. Now that I’ve actually got around to casting on, I’ve not found that colour online in enough quantity. So, I’ve bought some in other colours and it’ll have to be a stripy cardigan.

**Gauge**
5sts / 7.5 rows on 5mm needles.

**6000 Pullover Possibilities**
Saddle shoulders, knitted flat, square neck with mitred corners. Bottom up. Finished hip 44” = 106 back. 
Will follow size XS for gauge 7.

**Body**  
Cast on 106 sts using the COWYAK cast on method  [Tech Knitter](http://techknitting.blogspot.com/2007/10/cowyak-waste-yarn-method-of-provisional.html)  
10 rows of garter stitch

Do some stocking stitch for a few inches. Have a faux seam at the side i.e. a rib of 6sts p2 k2 p2. Front and back are therefore = 104 + 6 = 110 + 5 steak  
Dec 1st each side every 6 rows 7 times i.e. 2 sts front and back each round. => 90 + 6 = 96 + 5 steak  
Continue until body measures 17” less than the desired finished length.

**Increase for Bust**

Every 6 rows, increase 1st each side - 3 times
Every 8 rows, increase 1st each side - 4 times.

Continue until piece measures 10.5” less that desired finished length.

**Armholes**
Put 2 * 9 = 18 sts for each underarm onto a stitch holder. = 92 sts front and back. + 5 steak  
Now work front and back separately.

**Upper Back**
Continue until piece is 1.25” less than desired finished length.
